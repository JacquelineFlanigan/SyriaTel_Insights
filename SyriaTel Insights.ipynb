For instance, it is true that the model will learn more as the data set grows, but with it are the potential for outlier sensitivity that may skew results as well as the difficulty of finding out which is the true optimal number of neighbors to use. Furthermore, as the data set gets bigger, not only does KNN not have the capability to deal with missing value points, but the speed and efficiency of the model declines. With this in mind, while Nearest Neighbors might be the right model to use from some datasets, it seems unlikely that it will be our final model. \n"
